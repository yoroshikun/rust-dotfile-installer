## Rust Dotfile Manager

### Goals

#### Simplicity

The application should be simple to use and not require any arguments to function properly
Argurments are to be used to force a certain behavior rather than required to get a certain behavior

#### Modular

The application should be modular enough to allow for expanding any type of system link or configurations. eg (brew/cask installs, configs for commandline or programs)

#### Performant

The application must not underperform vanilla instalation of dot files using shell script.
Also the application must support co-currency

#### Universal

The application should function identically on multiple operating systems and version (unix based) with exception to windows where package manager packages may have issues.
